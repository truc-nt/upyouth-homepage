# Note to Judges

If you are a judge for the first round, please consider that my submission only includes up to the first commit. I was busy with other personal work during the 48-hour period for this round, which limited my ability to complete the project. However, I plan to continue working on the homepage to enhance my front-end skills. Your understanding of my situation is greatly appreciated.
